    <h1>What current issues does this water source have?</h1>
    <p>One main issue with waterfalls is drought. 
        With the climate heating there is less precipitation 
        meaning the waterfalls are drying up including the famous Victoria Falls which 
        stopped at one point. Another issue is pollution which is a big one because 
        most of Earth's waste gets put into water. This harms the animals and humans that use it. 
        Lastly, the construction of dams as a better alternative to fossil fuels may 
        reduce the water flow of waterfalls or even stop them completely.</p>
