    <h1>What are we doing to prevent or solve these issues?</h1>
    <p>As mentioned on page 5 some threats exist with waterfalls. 
        During droughts, we can conserve water through simple measures like fixing leaky pipes 
        and turning off the faucet while brushing teeth. Although these actions do not 
        directly fix the issue it will reduce the amount we take from these sources. 
        Regarding the creation of dams blocking water flow, other renewable energy sources 
        such as wind or geothermal can be a viable solution to keep generating energy while 
        keeping waterfalls.</p>
