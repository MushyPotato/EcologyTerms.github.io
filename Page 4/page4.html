    <h1>What living things use this water source?</h1>
    <p>The streams and rivers that are part of waterfalls hold many creatures. 
        Some of these include fish which can sometimes swim up them and survive the fall, 
        amphibians such as frogs which can use the mist to hydrate, many kinds of insects, 
        some birds which in the case of eagles and hawks can use it for a safe nesting place, 
        and many land animals like deer or wolves which might use the water above or below 
        the waterfall to drink.</p>
