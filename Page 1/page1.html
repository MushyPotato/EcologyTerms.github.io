    <h1>What is the water source and how is it formed?</h1>
    <p>A waterfall is where water flows over one or more vertical drops in a river or stream. 
        Waterfalls are most commonly formed when rivers flow over soft rock and erode it. 
        However they can also be formed by the movement of tectonic plates which can create cliffs 
        or by glaciers cutting out deep valleys that leave behind hanging valleys.</p>
